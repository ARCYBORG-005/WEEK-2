# Power BI CSV Analysis  

This repository documents the basic data processing and visualization operations performed in *Power BI* on a given CSV dataset.  

## *Operations Performed*  

### *1. Created Bins for "No of Product" Column*  
- Grouped values in the *"No of Product"* column into bins for better analysis.  

### *2. Applied Filter for Values Less Than 98 and 55*  
- Used Power BI filtering options to exclude values *greater than 98 and 55* in the dataset.  

### *3. Created a New Column by Multiplying "Order" Column with -1*  
- Added a calculated column where:  
  
  New Column = [Order] * 1.1
    

### *4. Established Relationships in Model View*  
- Connected relevant tables using relationships to maintain data integrity and enable cross-referencing in reports.  

### *5. Replaced Value "5" in "Availability" Column with "100"*  
- Used *Replace Values* in Power Query to update all occurrences of *5* in the *"Availability"* column to *100*.  

### *6. Created a Table View for the Average of "Revenue Generated" Column*  
- Designed a *table visualization* to display the *average revenue generated* from the dataset.  

### *7. Created a Bar Chart for Total Revenue Generated*  
- Visualized *total revenue generated* using a *bar chart* for better insights.  

### *8. Sorted "Revenue Generated" Column in Descending Order*  
- Sorted the *"Revenue Generated"* column from *highest to lowest* to highlight top revenue-generating entries.  

### *9. Removed Duplicates*  
- Used *Remove Duplicates* to clean the dataset and ensure uniqueness.  

### *10. Removed Unnecessary Columns by Duplicating the Original CSV File*  
- Created a duplicate of the *original CSV file* and removed unnecessary columns for a more refined dataset.  

## *Usage*  
This repository serves as a reference for basic *Power BI data processing* and *visualization*. You can apply similar techniques to other datasets for better insights.
